What does this do?

Connecting a random > 5 volt line that switches between on and off to a voltage sensor, the sensor is hooked up to a PCF8591 YL-40 module (AD DA)
If the voltage is above a threshold, the script sends a message to a group chat with your telegram bot in it.

This is running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+
